		<h1>The Best Hotels and Resorts in the U.S 2020</h1>

		<h3><a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/charleston/zero-george">Zero George</a></h3>

		<p>
			History is so much a part of the Charleston experience that you don’t want to leave it behind when returning to your hotel. At the three early-19th-century in-town “singles” and two carriage houses that form the Zero George, each of which comes with a pleasantly quiet, shaded courtyard nook to beat the steamy streets, you don’t have to. When plantation shutters are closed and the happy hour cheese board in the small bar is running low, sleep comes easily in one of the 16 rooms, which offer an unfussy palette of cream, gray, and sage, and not a lick of kitsch. Garden suites are sweet with heart pine floors and period millwork, though like the Dewberry down the street, the kitchen is the heart and soul of this place, as should be the case in the South. Chef Vinson Petrillo isn’t about pretense or elaborate sauces; royal red shrimp are served with generous amounts of heritage pork fat. This is classic Charleston, down to the deeply satisfying underfoot crunch of oyster shells in those nooks. Doubles from $359.

		<h3><a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/west-hollywood/west-hollywood/sunset-tower-hotel">Sunset Tower Hotel</a></h3>

		<p>
			Piercing the blue Californian skies on Sunset Boulevard, this elegant Art Deco tower has long been a landmark of the city, home to Hollywood greats since its arrival in 1931, courtesy of architect Leland A. Bryant. In those days it was Clark Gable and Greta Garbo, Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner—and John Wayne, who apparently kept a cow on his balcony to ensure fresh milk for his coffee. Now it’s shiny again after a multi-million-dollar renovation, and 21st-century stars are coming here just for a night or to grab a drink at the see-and-be-seen Tower Bar on the notorious Sunset Strip. Maître d’ Gabé Doppelt discreetly juggles regular guests such as Jennifer Aniston with those who prefer dim lighting or need private corners for tête-à-têtes, while the bottom of the menu firmly reads: "No photographs. No phone calls." The spicy tuna tartare is nearly everyone’s favorite; the seared scallops with black leek and truffle sauce a close second. The 81 bedrooms are done up in dusty pinks and browns with dazzling bathrooms clad in metallic gold wallpaper designed by fashionillustrator Donald Robertson, and there’s a Joanna Vargas spa for those red-carpet moments. The newly refreshed outdoor terrace overlooking the small but beautiful pool is one of the loveliest spots—in a city with a strong alfresco game—for a breakfast of mashed avocado on sourdough with poached eggs, or simply to relax for an hour or so, taking in the spectacular views of L.A. and basking in that brilliant golden sunshine. Doubles from $356.

		<h3><a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/dolores/dunton-hot-springs-dolores">Dunton Hot Springs</a></h3>

		<p>
			Located in an old mining town in the Colorado Rockies, Dunton Hot Springs combines the rustic feel of log cabin-living with the modern comforts of a resort. Nestled in a valley 8,850 feet up in the San Juan Mountains, Dunton is shaded by spruce, aspen, and cottonwood trees. Guests have six options for enjoying hot springs—such as under the stars or inside the bathhouse—and spa treatments, along with yoga sessions, enhance the restorative experience. Nine of the fourteen mining-era cabins at the rustic-chic resort thirty miles southwest of Telluride were relocated here from other parts of Colorado. The 1,500 private acres are home to bears, lynx, moose, deer, otters, cougars, foxes, and bald eagles. Dunton also has its own vineyard, library, and saloon, and the wilderness grounds are great for hiking and horseback riding. Cabins from $695.

		<h3><a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/los-angeles/los-angeles/surfrider-malibu">The Surfrider</a></h3>

		<p>
			For a low-key, personal stay in Los Angeles you can do no better. This light-filled, design-forward spot was a motel in the 1950s before a California architect and his Australian wife transformed it. Feel at ease in the cozy library, or chat it up with the staff who are Malibu natives.  There’s a proper bar with stools and multiple seating areas commanding amazing beach and sunset views—including comfy linen-covered couches facing a firepit. The roof deck is only open to hotel guests, the ocean is yards away, and Bellino linens on the beds maintain that perfect balance of luxurious and unpretentious. The owners are often around and willing to chat, and you should ask the staff—most born and raised in Malibu—for advice about the area. You really do feel like guests in one big family home. Doubles from $348.

		<h3><a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/forestville/forestville/the-farmhouse-inn">Farmhouse Inn</a></h3>

		<p>
			Even by the high standards of Northern California wine country, the Farmhouse Inn is something special. You know this as soon as you catch your first glimpse of the charming jumble of butter-colored cottages, tucked into a little wooded gully between the wineries of Sonoma County’s Russian River Valley, but it really becomes clear once you’re exposed to the easy graciousness of the hotel’s owners, siblings Joe and Katherine Bortolomei. They’re often around to say hi at reception, share tips on which estates to visit during their regular afternoon wine tastings, even offer an ad hoc report on the Tahoe snowpack during a chance meeting around the hotel grounds. (Joe’s a serious ski buff.) Once you meet them, you really understand the source of the hotel’s laidback sense of luxury, which extends from the double-sided indoor-outdoor fireplaces in the guestrooms to the Dutch stable doors and hand-painted horse murals in the spa, the most recent addition to the property. The Michelin-starred restaurant, housed in the 1873 weatherboard farmhouse that gives the hotel its name, has becomea destination in its own right for its delicious but unfussy way with the region’s prized produce, fish, and game, and of course the wine list—which includes Joe and Katherine’s own Lost & Found reds—is top-notch. Doubles from $491.

		<h3><a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/canada/tofino/wickaninnish-inn-tofino-b-c">Wickaninnish Inn</a></h3>

		<p>
			Tofino is like the Pacific Northwest’s older teenage cousin—loud, a little dangerous and always up for an adventure. The rugged cliffs and dense forests of Oregon and Washington to the south seem almost quaint compared to those of this remote district on Vancouver Island, off Canada’s west coast, where storm watching is a sport and cedars live to be 1,000 years old. In 1996, a decade before the area became a destination for outdoorsy professionals in Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans—the former fishing town’s popularity has risen in direct proportion to improved wetsuit technology—the Wick opened its hand-carved wooden doors overlooking Chesterman Beach. When one of those gales is blowing, it’s tempting to hunker down, pulling up a cloud-like duvet and watching the ocean rage, settling fireside with a bowl of chowder and an inch of Macallan, or sampling regional cooking at the restaurant (excellent, although the beachfront summertime crab cookouts of whole Dungeness and corn-on-the-cob are even better). But that’s missing the point of the place, which is all for getting visitors outdoors, as the hurricane lantern and bright-yellow rain gear in every room attest. The weather changes in a blink, and the last thing guests need to worry about when hiking the Big Tree Trail on nearby Meares Island—or hiding behind a blackberry bush to spy on a black bear foraging for starfish at low tide—is wet socks. Doubles from about $249.

		<h3><a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/new-york/greenwich-hotel">The Greenwich Hotel</a></h3>

		<p>
			In an era of the ever-more-exclusive members’ club luring the black-card-carrying wolf pack, Robert De Niro’s hotel makes privacy feel refreshingly effortless. Built more than a decade ago in a cobblestone quarter of Lower Manhattan, it creates the sensation of stepping into the actor’s own salon. The lobby is hung with abstract paintings by De Niro’s late father, and beyond it more inner sanctums await: A book-filled drawing room merges into a pocket garden, where topiaries cast an Italianate charm. Each of the 88 rooms is idiosyncratically arranged with antique silk rugs, the odd vintage table, and marble bathtubs, while the TriBeCa Penthouse is earthy and minimalist. But the enduring revelation is the Shibui Spa, where the lantern-lit pool glimmers under the beams of a 250-year-old Japanese farmhouse. A festive din still kicks up at Locanda Verde, which serves rustic plates of duck orecchiette, and New York fixtures such as Yoko Ono and Jay-Z go pretty much incognito, but things settle down early. The wolf pack can go elsewhere. Doubles from about $755.

		<h3><a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/nantucket/the-wauwinet-nantucket">The wauwinet</a></h3>

		<p>
			One of the top hotels in tony Nantucket, and  part of the larger Nantucket Island Resorts, which runs multiple properties on the island. The Wauwinet is the only Relais & Chateaux property on Nantucket, and was founded in 1875. Back in the day, rooms started at $7 per night. The rooms are spacious, with a high bed that you want to climb into immediately. Just about every room also has a large terrace with wicker lounge chairs. The terraces lead out to the back of the hotel, where you can walk to a lawn with sun-loungers, to the beach, or to the dock where you can take the Wauwinet Lady boat to downtown. The Wauwinet's main restaurant, Topper's, is an island standby. Must-orders here are all seafood-based, of course, but don't overlook the pate, their signature chowder, or the soft shell crab BLT when it's seasonally available. The Wauwinet is set off from the other attractions and hotels on the island, which is part of its charm. But its got an hourly shuttle that can take you to the heart of downtown, where the action is. Doubles from $201.
